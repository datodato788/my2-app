    <div><p className={styles.p}>Deontay Wilder</p>
    <p>(/ˈwaɪldər/; born October 22, 1985) is an American professional boxer. He held the WBC heavyweight title from 2015 to 2020.
         By winning the title, Wilder became the first American world heavyweight champion since 2007, which was the longest period 
         of time in boxing history without an American heavyweight champion. As of April 2023, he is ranked as the world's third-best
          active heavyweight by The Ring magazine, ESPN and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board and fifth by BoxRec.

Wilder had a late start to boxing, taking up the sport at 20 years of age. As an amateur, he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight 
division at the 2008 Olympics. This led to his nickname of "The Bronze Bomber", which Wilder coined after Joe Louis, who was known
 by the nickname of "The Brown Bomber".

Wilder is known for his exceptional punching power, having knocked out every opponent he has defeated, and has been described as
 one of the hardest punchers in boxing history. His knockout-to-win percentage stands at 97.67%, the highest in heavyweight
  history,[10] with 20 of his knockouts (48%) in the first round. He is a three-time winner of the Premier Boxing Champions Knockout
   of the Year award (2016, 2017, 2019) and a winner of the Ring magazine Knockout of the Year award (2019)</p></div>
