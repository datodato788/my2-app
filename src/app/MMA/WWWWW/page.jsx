Emelianenko was the PRIDE Heavyweight Champion from 2003 to the organisation's closure in 2007, a four-time combat sambo world champion, and two-time Russian national judo bronze medalist, among other championships and accolades. He also competed in RINGS, Strikeforce, M-1 Global, Rizin, and Bellator, and is regarded as the most prominent fighter never to compete in the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship).[11] Emelianenko is widely considered to be one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, consistently ranked as the top heavyweight fighter from 2003 until 2010, and the best fighter of the 2000s.[12][13][14][15] Emelianenko's career helped popularize the sport of MMA in his home country of Russia after gaining attention in Japan, South Korea, the United States, and worldwide.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22]

Emelianenko began his MMA career on May 21, 2000, compiling four straight victories before a controversial loss in December 2000. Emelianenko was unbeaten in his next 28 fights up until June 2010, including wins over four former UFC champions, one PRIDE champion, one former and two future K-1 champions, and two Olympic medalists. He originally retired in June 2012 before making his return in December 2015. Emelianenko retired for the second and final time on February 4, 2023, with a record of 41 wins, 7 losses, and 1 no contest.

Emelianenko began his political career in 2010, being elected as a deputy of the Belgorod Regional Duma.[23] He subsequently became president of the Russian MMA Union (later honorary president and chairman of the supervisory board), and a staff member of Russia's Council of Physical Fitness & Sports.[24][25][26][27]</p></div>
